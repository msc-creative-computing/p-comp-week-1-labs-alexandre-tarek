The idea behind this mysterious device is to reintroduce playfulness in a purpose-oriented, highly-optimised society.

It has no purpose. Its origin is unknown. Its interface is mostly hidden.

It is spread out accross the countless flats of futuristic buildings. It is designed to spread like a virus.

Sooner or later, a hidden button - that is no longer recognised as such - is pressed, by accident or on purpose, somewhere in one of the flats.

In each flats of the complex, on one of the walls that also serve as screens, a tiny dot of colored light appears. It is lost in the visual complexity of the screen. But sooner or later, it is noticed.

If another button within the complex is pressed, the color changes.

The logic of this world cannot attune to this tiny, inexplicable detail.
