Centuries after ours, the current world order has been able to maintain itself through ceaseless control and optimisation of all human processes. Until a grain of sand found its way into the gears.

A mysterious device is spread out within gigantic futuristic buildings. Its origin is unknown. Its interface almost invisible.

In each flat, there is a small button hidden in plain sight. Some will never notice it. Those that pay attention to it might not recognize this dated technology. Sooner or later, someone might press it, be it by accident or curiosity. It seemingly has no effect.

However, in each flat of the complex, on a random surface, a tiny colored dot is lit, lost within the visual complexity of their screen-like surfaces. If another button is pressed within the complex, the color changes in each flat. Years might pass before someone even notices it.

What might happen when people realise there is an inexplicable dot of colored light in their flats?

The purpose of this device is to have no purpose. In having no purpose, it disrupts the merciless logic and order of its world.

Not only are the affordances mostly hidden, but the feedback is so weak that it is almost impossible to make out the causality relationships between the buttons and the lights..
Even when the “how” is solved, the “why” remains. It has no answer.

In a world that values order above all and doesn’t tolerate the unexpected, this device is designed to spark imagination, investigation, or hysteria.
